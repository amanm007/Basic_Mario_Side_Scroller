# Basic_Mario_Side_Scroller
This is Mario like 2D game made on unity. Doesnt have a build file for this but you pull the project on open on Unity to play the game.
Game uses only WASD commands and also supports ps4/ps5 controller inputs
controller inputs-->joystick to move around and sqaure for jump.
Thanks
